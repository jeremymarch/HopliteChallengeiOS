<h2>Using the Keyboard</h2>
</center>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Accents and other diacritics should be typed after their vowel. If a vowel has more than one diacritic, they can be entered in any order.  Pressing the same diacritic key again toggles off the diacritic; pressing a mutually exclusive diacritic will replace the original diacritic with the second, so pressing the circumflex for a vowel which already has an acute replaces the acute accent with a circumflex.</li>
    <li>Press the MF button if there are multiple forms.  The first press gives you 50% more time.  Subsequent presses add commas to separate the forms. If there is only one form, though, pressing MF will immediately result in the attempt being marked incorrect, so use it with caution!</li>
    <li>For nu-movable, press the nu key followed by the () key.</li>
    <li>You can move the cursor back in the word to add an accent or make a correction by holding your finger over the word for a couple of seconds.  A magnifying lense is displayed to help you place the cursor.
    </ul>

    <h2>External Keyboard</h2>
    </center>
    The Hoplite Challenge app can be used with an external keyboard.  Roman letters will be transliterated into Greek letters.  Other keys function as below:
    <ul>
        <li>1 = Rough Breathing</li>
        <li>2 = Smooth Breathing</li>
        <li>3 = Acute</li>
        <li>5 = Circumflex</li>
        <li>6 = Macron</li>
        <li>8 = Iota Subscript</li>
        <li>0 = Parentheses for nu movable</li>
        <li>Return = Submit an answer</li>
        <li>Space = Continue</li>
        <li>Tab = Multiple Forms</li>
        <li>Comma = Comma to separate multiple forms</li>
    </ul>
