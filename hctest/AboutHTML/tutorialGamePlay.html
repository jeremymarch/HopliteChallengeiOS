        <div class="subtitle">Game Play</div>
        <ul>
            <li>You will be presented with a verb form. Change the given form to the form indicated by the prompt. If you can do so correctly in 30 seconds or less, you score points. If your form is incorrect or time runs out, you lose a life <img src="Life4X.png" style="height:18px;width:18px;display:inline;">.</li>
            <li>Correct forms serve as the starting point for the next change. After four correct forms from the same verb, a bonus is awarded and play resumes from a new verb.</li>
            <li>Incorrect forms will cost a life; the correct form will be displayed below.  Press Continue to resume play with a new verb.</li>
            <li>You start the game with three lives, indicated in the top right corner by this symbol <img src="Life4X.png" style="height:18px;width:18px;display:inline;">. The game continues until you lose all of your lives.</li>
            <li>Forms will be described by their morphology. For example, the deponent <span class="greek">ἐβουλήθην</span>
                which is active in meaning, but passive in morphology, will be described as passive.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="subtitle">Hansen &amp; Quinn Units</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the Settings button from the Main Menu to select which Hansen &amp; Quinn units you would like to include in your game.
                <ul><li>In Play mode, the game will include all verbs in the highest selected unit and under. So selecting unit 5 will also include units 1-4.</li>
                    
                    <li>In Practice mode, only the verbs from the selected units are included, so you can focus on the unit(s) of interest.</li></ul></li>
            
            <li>For unit 2, you will be prompted to change only one parameter. In higher units, two changes will be requested for each form.</li>
            <li>The game does not currently ask for periphrastic forms.</li>
            <li>The game does not currently ask for the base form of verbs which require a prefix such as <span class="greek" style="white-space: nowrap;">-ἔβην</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="subtitle">Multiple Forms</div>
        <ul>
            <li>If the requested form has multiple forms, give them all.  Enter multiple forms by pressing the MF key.
                <ul>
                    <li>The first press will add 50% more time to the timer to compensate for the extra difficulty.</li>
                    <li>Press the MF key again to type a comma to separate the forms.</li>
                </ul>
            </li></ul>
        
        <div class="subtitle">Scoring</div>
        <ul>
            <li>For each correct form you will receive points equal to the highest selected unit. For example, if the highest selected unit is 19, you will receive 19 points per correct answer. After entering four correct forms from the same verb, you will receive bonus points equal to the highest selected unit.</li>
        </ul>
